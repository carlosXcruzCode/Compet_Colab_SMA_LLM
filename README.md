# Transforming Competition into Collaboration: The Revolutionary Role of Multi-Agent AI Systems and Language Models in Modern Organizations

This article explores the dynamic influence of computational entities based on multi-agent systems theory (SMA) combined with large language models (LLM), which are characterized by their ability to simulate complex human interactions, as a possibility to revolutionize the potential of human interaction. -machine based on the use of specialized virtual agents to support everything from operational organizational processes to strategic decision-making based on applied knowledge and human orchestration. Previous investigations reveal that there are limitations, particularly in the autonomous approach of virtual agents, especially when dealing with new challenges and pragmatic tasks such as inducing logical reasoning and problem solving. It is also considered that traditional techniques, such as the stimulation of chains of thoughts, require explicit human guidance. In our approach we employ agents developed from large language models (LLM), each with distinct prototyping that considers behavioral elements, driven by strategies that stimulate the generation of knowledge based on the use case proposed in the scenario (role-play). business, using a discussion approach between agents (guided conversation). We demonstrate the potential of developing agents useful for organizational strategies, based on multi-agent system theories (SMA) and innovative uses based on large language models (LLM based), offering a differentiated and adaptable experiment to different applications, complexities, domains and capabilities from LLM.
